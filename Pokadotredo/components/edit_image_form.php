    This file will have similar functionality to the Edit Image forms
    we created in Project 3. It will also have similar form validation 
    implemented as in the contact_form.php and sign_up_form.php file. 
    This form will allow the admin, when logged in, to add/edit/delete images 
    and their descriptions on the website. This form will only be visible 
    if the user is logged in as an admin. We will use regexes and filter 
    input functions to implement form validation. We will also prevent 
    code injection by stripping HTML tags and elements. Furthermore, we 
    will integrate the validation feedback by detecting which fields have 
    invalid inputs and display appropriate feedback messages. What the 
    specific validation code implementation will look like is similar to 
    what is currently in the file contact_form.php. We will use php code to validate 
    inputs, interact with the database, and upload files in a similar way to what we 
    did in Project 3.
