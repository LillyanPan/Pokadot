	This page will only show when a user has logged in as an admin through the 
	special external url provided to the client. Currently, we plan to code the
	forms in separate php files and include the files where needed. We plan to 
	include forms for adding/deleting images, adding/deleting groups, and 
	adding/deleting images from groups. We will use php code to validate inputs, 
	interact with the database, and upload files (similar to what we did in 
	Project 3). However, depending on what the client further specifies, we may 
	add more forms to accommodate for other functionalities. The main code
	in this file will be laying out the forms on the Edit page.
